# Code book for 'UCI HAR Dataset final_tidy_set.txt'
Features and applied workflows for this dataset is described below.

## Work flow
1. Download the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Create separate data.frames for train, test, features, and activity labels from unzipped files.
   train_x : "/train/X_train.txt"
   train_y : "/train/y_train.txt"
   train_subject : "/train/subject_train.txt"
   test_x : "/test/X_test.txt"
   test_y : "/test/y_test.txt"
   test_subject : "/test/subject_test.txt"
   features : "/features.txt"
   activity_labels : "/activity_labels.txt"
4. Change column names of the created data.frames.
   train_x, test_x : Second column of 'features' data.frame.
   train_y, test_y : "activityID"
   train_subject, test_subject : "subjectID"
   activity_labels : "activityID", "activityType"
5. Merge data.frames
   train_merge : merging train_y, train_subject, train_x
   test_merge : merging test_y, test_subject, test_x
   all_merge : merging train_merge and test_merge
6. Feature extraction
 Â  mean_std : A vector of columns including activityID, subjectID, and all columns with 'mean' and 'std'.
   mean_std_merge_set : Subset of 'all_merge' with columns included in 'mean_std'.
7. Aggregate the subset
   tidy_set : An aggregated set of mean_std_merge_set by subjectID and activityID
8. Activity labeling
   final_tidy_set : Merging tidy_set and activityLables by activityID.
9. Export the result as a file
   UCI HAR Dataset final_tidy_set.txt
