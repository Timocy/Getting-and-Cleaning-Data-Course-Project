# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This repo is about the course project for getting and cleaning data. 
The code, 'run_analysis.R', performs a series of action from downloading, merging, and aggregating in order to create one tidy set.

1. Download the source file.
2. Create disperate datasets for each file (train, test, features, activity labels)
3. Rename columns of the datasets.
4. Merge datasets (train, test).
5. Extract relevant features (mean, std) and create a subset.
6. Create a tidy set by aggregation (subjectID, activityID).
7. Add activity labels by merging with activity labels set.
8. Save the result as a file (UCI HAR Dataset final_tidy_set.txt).
